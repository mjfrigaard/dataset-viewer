# Motivation

This application was designed to quickly assess the contents of a given dataset, and answer some "big picture" questions before you start digging into an analysis. Another reason this application exists is that I wanted to build an application with the [`golem` package](https://thinkr-open.github.io/golem/), which is covered in-depth in [Engineering Production-Grade Shiny Apps](https://engineering-shiny.org/structure.html). 

```{r packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(Lahman)
library(visdat)
library(listviewer)
library(tidyverse)
library(reactable)
library(repurrrsive)
```
